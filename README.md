# FlowerSpeciesPredictor

This project was proposed as the final assessment in the [PyTorch Scholarship Challenge Nanodegree Program](https://br.udacity.com/facebook-pytorch-scholarship). It is implemented in the *PyTorch* environment.

In this project, I will train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers, then generate and save the corresponding model, and further use it to predict flower species from an independent flower image. The model will use a dataset of 102 flower categories for training, reference in the IPython Notebook file.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

* Load and preprocess the image dataset
* Load a pre-trained model
* Train the image classifier on the dataset
* Use the trained classifier to predict image content
